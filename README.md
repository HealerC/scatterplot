This bar chart represents the GDP of the United States of America from 1947 to 2015 divided into four for each quarter of the year.

This is a one of the projects on freecodecamp on data visualization - 
[Visualize Data with a Bar Chart](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart)

It is basically a bar chart showing the GDP in each quarter of the year 1947 to 2015).
When the mouse is hovered on each bar, it shows the data for that particular year as a tooltip.
Double clicking the bar copies the raw data to the clipboard in case the user needs it for further analysis.

[Here's](https://codepen.io/HealerC/full/WNGwPzE) the demonstration at codepen.
