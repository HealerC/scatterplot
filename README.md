# Doping in Professional Bicycle Racing (Scatterplot)
The scatter plot shows cyclists that may have allegations of doping in their career while 
some of them may have confessed to doping after their careers 

This is a one of the projects on freecodecamp on data visualization - 
[Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-scatterplot-graph)

It is basically a scatterplot created with D3 and SVG containing dots which are coloured differently
depending on whether the player has doping allegations or not. It visualizes the cyclist's fastest time up Alpe d'Huez 
- A mountain pasture [used as a cycling venue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpe_d%27Huez).
When the dots are hovered on, they show information of the particular cyclist.

When the legend is clicked on, lines are drawn connecting dots of players that have more than one datapoint in the graph
